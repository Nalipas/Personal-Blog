## Description

In this repository you will find the source code, reference links, and related documents used to create a simple blog page. The application features a form where you can write and submit a blog post, and if the posting is successful, the user is redirected to the blog page, where you can see the submitted post, as well as any posts made previously. These posts are stored as strings in localStorage on the form page and then parsed into separate article elements on the blog page. As the posts are stored locally, viewing the page on a new browser, or clearing your browser data, will remove any posts on the blog page. 

In the header, you can find navigation links and a dark mode toggle button, which updates the styling of the page. The users preference is also stored in localStorage, so the styling persists through both the form and blog pages. In the footer, you can find links to my LinkedIn profile, portfolio website, and twitch.tv channel.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This website was built and tested using Chromium based browsers <a href="https://www.opera.com/gx">Opera GX</a> and <a href="(https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> on a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10%20">Windows 10</a> machine, but should be viewable on any HTML supported browser.

This website was built using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting">CSS nesting</a>, a relatively new feature. If you have issues viewing this webpage on your browser, please <a href="mailto:smoreno2014@gmail.com">contact me</a>.

### Installing and Executing

There are no install directions here.

You can find the published website hosted at 
<a href="https://nalipas.github.io/Personal-Blog/">https://nalipas.github.io/Personal-Blog/</a>

```
* Three text entry boxes are presented to you, the user, on the home/form page.
* Enter your desired Username, Title, and Content for the blog post.
    * All of these fields are required.
* When you are satisfied with your post, click the 'SUBMIT POST' button.
    * If any fields are left blank, the site will return an error. Correct any issues and try again.
* Upon successful entry, you will be redirected to the blog page.
```

On the blog page, you will find your blog post, as well as any previous blog posts you have submitted. These posts are in order of newest first. As the data for the posts is stored in local storage, these blog posts are only available to you on the current browser, and thus clearing your browsing data (local storage) will delete the posts.
